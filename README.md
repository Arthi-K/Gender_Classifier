# Gender_Classifier
Classify author names based on Gender. Taking the original dataset, I have first used the gender_guessor package to classify the author names as either Male or Female based on their first names. Since a lot of the names went classified as Unknown, I split this classified dataset (the ones that were properly classified as Male or Female, ignoring the Unknowns) into a 66:33 ratio and trained the model with the 66% data and then tested it with the remaining 33%. The model gave 98% accuracy in prediction. Then I took the dataset, which had a lot of Unknowns and passed it as input to the Naive Bayes classifier. This yielded the results stored in the output file.
